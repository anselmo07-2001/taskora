Taskora is a lightweight and straightforward project management tool I built to help teams stay organized. It lets admins and project managers create projects and tasks, assign them to members, and keep track of progress. Once a task is marked as done by a member, a manager or admin can review and approve it.

Who Can Do What?
Admin
Admins have full access across the entire system:
Tasks: Create, edit, delete, and view every task. They can change task statuses anytime—even after approval. Tasks can also be filtered by due date or searched by name.
Task Notes: Add, edit, or delete any task note in the system.
Accounts: Create new users, filter by role, search, update info, change passwords, suspend, or delete accounts.
Projects: Create, view, edit, delete projects, and update their status.

Project Manager
Managers handle everything related to the projects they’re assigned:
Tasks: Manage tasks under their projects—create, edit, delete, update status, search, and filter by due date.
Task Notes: Add, edit, and delete notes on their own tasks.
Projects: Create and manage their own projects from start to finish.

Member
Members focus only on the work assigned to them:
Tasks: View individual and group tasks, and update their status once done.
Task Notes: Add, edit, or delete only their own notes—nothing else.
